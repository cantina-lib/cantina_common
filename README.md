## Cantina common

Featuring :

* Macros
* Common types, Exceptions
* Maths library (bare-bones, so far)
* Template Physics engine, a joy to debug!
* Event listening routine
* General time management

All in all, useful stuff that's used in Cantina and Pantoufle. Some of this is just me tinkering with bits 
I saw somewhere and trying to emulate it (like the physics simulation) with varying degrees of success.

This is a header-only library, it can be compiled against by including this directory in CMake.
The CMake project also includes the compiling which are used project-wide.
There's also a format that's meant to be respected in Cantina as a whole.

And a cat. It's still here, it hasn't moved, you can still come and say hi.
